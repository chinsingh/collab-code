# Guide for efficient collaboration

By adhering to these principles, we can collaborate more efficiently while respecting each other’s time, priorities, and commitments. If you follow these practices, it reflects mutual respect, and I’m deeply appreciative of that consideration.

1. **Be Kind**: A little empathy goes a long way.
2. **[No Hello](https://nohello.club)**: Skip unnecessary greetings in chat and get to the point for efficient communication. 
3. **Attendees <= 3**: Keep decision-making meetings small to enhance focus and effectiveness. Aim for fewer than 8 attendees, but ideally, keep it under 3. [Read more about the rule of eight](https://www.rubick.com/the-rule-of-eight-for-strong-decision-making-meetings/).

4. **Your Lack of Planning Is Not My Emergency**: I’ll do my best to support your work, but please understand that I have other commitments and priorities. Last-minute requests cannot take precedence over pre-existing plans.
5. **Take a deep breath**: After making a request, please allow adequate time for a response. Frequent follow-ups can unintentionally interrupt focus. Rest assured, your request is valued and will be addressed as soon as possible. If needed, feel free to propose a specific date and time for the next follow-up to ensure alignment without causing unnecessary disruptions.
