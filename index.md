# Guide for efficient collaboration

By adhering to these principles, we can collaborate more efficiently while respecting each other’s time, priorities, and commitments. If you follow these practices, it reflects mutual respect, and I’m deeply appreciative of that consideration.

1. **Be Kind** and empathetic.
2. **[No Hello](https://nohello.club)**: I won't be offended if you skip the pleasantries and get straight to the point. Do still be polite, and feel free to have social conversations!
3. **Attendees <= 3**: Keep decision-making meetings small to enhance focus and effectiveness. Aim for fewer than 8 attendees, but ideally, keep it under 3. [Read more about the rule of eight](https://www.rubick.com/the-rule-of-eight-for-strong-decision-making-meetings/).

4. **Take a Deep Breath**: I’ll do my best to support your work, but please understand that I have other commitments. Last-minute requests and frequent follow-ups can disrupt focus and may not take priority over pre-existing plans. When making a request, allow time for a response, and feel free to schedule follow-ups or calls in advance to ensure smooth collaboration.
